# ubuntu-fresh-bootstrapper
Small script to help users install some software, 
most of it installed by many people after clean installation anyway.

Just place the file anywhere in your PC and run it like 
./BootstrapUbuntu.sh

If it is not allowed to execute then change the permissions of the file, for example:
chmod +x BootstrapUbuntu.sh

Hopefully it helps someone.
